## Simple Mail Client

This is a simple mail client that will be used to programatically send emails to users. 


I don't know too much about the email packages and the smtp packages but I'm sure I can learn. T

There is also such a thing as ESMTP operations, I have no idea what that is, will investigate.

I found out that ESMTP is called Extended Simple mail transfer protocol, which is pretty much just the SMTP ( simple mail transfer protocol) but with extended functionality.
